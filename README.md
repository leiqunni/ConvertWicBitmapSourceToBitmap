# WIC Image Viewer Using WicNet Visual Basic .NET Sample Code

image or gif

## Overview

This is Visual Basic .NET sample code for loading and displaying an image file using WIC (Windows Imaging Component).
Because I didn't know how to convert from WicBitmapSource to Bitmap (sorry this code is not complete).

## Requirement

* [WicNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WicNet)
* [DirectNStandard](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DirectNStandard)

## Usage

If you provide the file name of an image to WicBitmapSource.Load(filename), 
the image format will be automatically detected and a WicBitmapSource will be obtained.

Next, convert it to a Bitmap using ConvertWicBitmapSourceToBitmap, and you can use it in .NET.
